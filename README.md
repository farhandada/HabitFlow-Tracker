# HabitFlow Tracker

## Overview
HabitFlow Tracker is a user-friendly habit-tracking application designed to help users build and maintain positive habits with ease and motivation. The app features customizable tracking, progress visualization, and motivational celebrations to keep users engaged.

## Features
- **Progress Tracking**: Use a sliding bar to visually track your progress, with percentage increments displayed as you move closer to your goal. For habits that require multiple completions, such as daily prayers, the bar will update with each completed increment.
- **Customizable Habits**: Easily add new habits with specific targets and measurements. The application offers default values and examples to guide users in setting up their habits. Users can override progress by directly entering numbers and add more if a task is completed multiple times.
- **User Guidance**: The app provides habit suggestions upon first opening and allows users to exit the add habit form without adding a habit, ensuring a smooth user experience.
- **Detailed Progress Display**: The progress bar not only shows the percentage but also the numeric amount, allowing users to see their progress at a glance. Even if the progress exceeds the target, the application displays percentages over 100%.
